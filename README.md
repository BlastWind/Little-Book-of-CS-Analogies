# Introduction

I've came across many beautiful quotes, stories, and analogies in the field of Computer Science. Some sub-fields, like cryptography and OS, are already frequently taught using human interaction analogies. Other fields, like Theory of Computation, unfortunately but unsurprisingly, do not have that many real-life analogies. But, I believe it is a great mission to find and document these analogies, as they not only serve great pedagogical purposes, but also, makes our dull lives just a bit more interesting.

So, this little book attempts to do two things:

1. Document existing analogies. These analogies are often already named. An example would be the Pigeonhole principle. &#x20;
2. Gather unnamed but viable and interesting analogies, supplied by â€” you! To add to this book, simply open a pull request to the bi-directionally synced repository [here](https://github.com/BlastWind/Little-Book-of-CS-Analogies).
