# Introduction

In my short advent in learning about CS thus far, I've came across many beautiful quotes, stories, and analogies. Some fields of CS, like cryptography and OS, already frequently use human interaction analogies in teaching. Other fields, like Theory of Computation, unfortunately but unsurprisingly, do not have that many real-life analogies. But I believe it is a great mission to find and document these analogies, as they serve great pedagogical purposes.

So, this little book serves two purposes

1. To document the existing analogies&#x20;
2. To gather interesting analogies, supplied by â€” you!
